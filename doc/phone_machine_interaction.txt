Goal: The purpose of these notes is to identify the interactions between the an
application running on a phone and RaspberryLatte running on the pi. The
communication is over MQTT.


Minimal Case: The phone transmits settings updates to the pi. The pi transmits
the current state to the phone. The settings that can be updated include the
temperatures. The state includes the current temperature and machine state.
When a connection is first made, the pi should transmit the current machine
settings to the phone.

To easily transmit the settings back and forth, a class that holds them all
and encodes them into a char array would be useful.
